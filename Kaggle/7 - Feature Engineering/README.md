This course covered the improvement of machine learning models with feature engineering.

Topics:
- Goals of feature engineering (improve predictive performance, computational/data needs, and result interpretability)
- Mutual information (measurement of a feature's potential)
- Creating features (mathematical transforms, counts, feature build-up/break-down, and group transforms)
- Cluster labels and k-means clustering
- Principal component analysis
- Target encoding
