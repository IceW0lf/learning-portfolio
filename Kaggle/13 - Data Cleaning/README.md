This course covered workflows for dealing with real-world data.

Topics:
- Missing Values (why values are missing and how to handle them)
- Scaling (changing the range of the data)
- Normalization (changing the shape of the data distribution)
- Date parsing (datetime conversion)
- Character encodings (reading in files and dealing with encoding problems)
- Inconsistent data entries (data pre-processing)
