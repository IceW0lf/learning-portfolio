This course covered standard Python syntax.

Topics:
- Defining and calling functions
- Python's built-in documentation
- Branching logic with booleans and conditionals
- List operations (indexing, slicing, mutability, and list functions)
- Loops and list comprehensions
- Strings and dictionaries
- External libraries (imports and operator overloading)

This course served as a refresher and was done for the sake of completeness.
