This course covered the core ideas of deep learning.

Topics:
- Neurons (linear units and building blocks of deep learning)
- Keras (Python library)
- Deep neural networks (layer, activation function, and layer stacking)
- Stochastic gradient descent (loss function, optimizer, learning rate, and batch size)
- Overfitting and underfitting (interpretation of learning curves)
- Dropout and batch normalization
- Binary Classification (accuracy, cross-entropy, and sigmoid activation function)
