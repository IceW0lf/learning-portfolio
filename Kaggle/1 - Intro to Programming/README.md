This course covered basic Python syntax.

Topics:
- Arithmetic and Variables (define and modify variables to make calculations)
- Functions (organize code and avoid redundancy)
- Data Types (integer, float, boolean, and string)
- Conditions and Conditional Statements (modify functions depending on the input)
- Intro to Lists (organize data to work efficiently)

This course served as a refresher and was done for the sake of completeness.
