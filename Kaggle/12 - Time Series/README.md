This course covered how machine learning can be applied to real-world forecasting tasks.

Topics:
- Time series (time-step and lag features)
- Trend and moving average plots
- Seasonality (seasonal plots, seasonal indicators, fourier features, and the periodogram)
- Serial dependence (cycles, lagged series, lag plots, and partial autocorrelation)
- Hybrid models (residuals and the combination of complementary learning algorithms)
- Forecasting tasks and data preparation
- Forecasting strategies (multioutput model, direct strategy, recursive strategy, DirRec strategy)
