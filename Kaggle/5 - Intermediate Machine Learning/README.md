This course expanded upon the core ideas of machine learning.

Topics:
- Missing values and imputation
- Categorical variables (ordinal encoding and one-hot encoding)
- Pipelines (preprocessing, creation, and evaluation)
- Cross-validation (model performance measurement)
- Gradient boosting and XGBoost
- Data leakage (target leakage and train-test contamination)
