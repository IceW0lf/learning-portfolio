This course covered basic SQL syntax.

Topics:
- BigQuery (Google service allowing the application of SQL to datasets)
- SELECT, FROM, and WHERE (dataset examination)
- GROUP BY, HAVING, and COUNT (data selection)
- ORDER BY (data ordering)
- AS and WITH (improving data readability)
- JOIN (combining data sources)

This course served as a refresher and was done for the sake of completeness.
