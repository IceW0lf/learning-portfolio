This course covered the core ideas of machine learning.

Topics:
- How models work (introduction of decisions trees)
- Data exploration (loading and understanding data)
- Building a first decisions tree model with scikit-learn
- Model validation (measure the performance of a model)
- Underfitting and overfitting (model performance fine-tuning)
- Random Forests (averaging the predictions of multiple decision trees)
